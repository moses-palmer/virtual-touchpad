Virtual Touchpad
================

This application allows you to use a mobile phone or tablet as a touchpad for
your computer.

No software needs to be installed on the device.


How does it work?
-----------------

A simple HTTP server is started on the computer, and the device connects by
simply opening a URL in a browser.

To manually start the HTTP server, run the following command:

    python -m virtualtouchpad

This will start a HTTP server. It will print the line

    Starting server http://<computer name>:<port>/...

Open this URL on your device to start controlling your computer.
